title: What is Orisun?
description: What Orisun is, the guarantees it makes, and where to start.

Orisun is an open-source event database for decisions that must stay correct as facts change. It preserves complete event history and lets applications declare the events a command depends on. Orisun commits the resulting events only if that declared context is still current, then publishes committed events sequentially within each boundary.

This documentation targets Orisun `0.6.1`.

The mechanism behind that promise is **Command Context Consistency**: commands query the exact events they depend on, and writes succeed only if that context has not changed. Orisun can also be used as a **Dynamic Consistency Boundary** event store, where append conditions are expressed over event types and queryable JSON tags.

It stores the event log transactionally in PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, SQLite, or FoundationDB beta, and delivers committed events through embedded NATS JetStream, including catch-up replay and live subscriptions. Storage, consistency checks, publishing, indexes, auth, and gRPC APIs ship as one deployable server.

## Guarantees

- **Decisions scoped to real context.** A write declares the event subset it depends on with JSON criteria and commits only if that subset is unchanged. You do not need to force every invariant into a single stream.
- **DCB-compatible append conditions.** Use `expected_position` plus `subsetQuery` to append only when a dynamic event set has not changed.
- **No skipped committed events.** A durable per-boundary checkpoint drives at-least-once publishing. Wake-up signals can be missed; committed events still drain sequentially within the boundary.
- **Per-boundary ordering.** Events publish in ascending log position within each boundary.
- **Runtime boundary management.** New and imported physical boundaries are
  durable lifecycle events, provisioned without restarting the server or
  maintaining a startup boundary list.
- **Same API on every backend.** SQLite, PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, and FoundationDB expose the identical gRPC surface, so deployments can grow without client changes.

## How it works

1. **Store** events transactionally in the selected backend.
2. **Check** command consistency by querying the event subset the command depends on.
3. **Publish** committed events sequentially per boundary from durable checkpoints.
4. **Subscribe** with catch-up replay from storage, then live JetStream delivery.

## Quick start

SQLite is the fastest local loop. Event log, admin state, indexes, publisher checkpoints, and embedded JetStream run from one binary with no separate database.

1. Download `orisun-sqlite` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OrisunLabs/Orisun/releases).
2. Start it with the [SQLite binary example](/docs/getting-started#run-sqlite-from-a-binary).
3. Verify gRPC with [Verify the API](/docs/getting-started#verify-the-api).
4. Define the application log with
   [Create the SQLite boundary](/docs/getting-started#create-the-sqlite-boundary)
   and wait for it to become active.
5. Save an event with [Save your first event](/docs/getting-started#save-your-first-event).

Move to PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, or FoundationDB when you need multiple Orisun nodes or database-managed operations. SQLite is single-node only and requires NATS clustering disabled. FoundationDB support is beta; read the FoundationDB operations guide before using it in production.

## When Orisun fits

Use Orisun when:

- commands need to read event history before deciding what to write,
- stale context would make an otherwise valid command unsafe,
- consistency depends on a subset of events, not always a fixed stream,
- projectors need to recover from downtime without relying only on broker retention,
- you want the event store, publisher, gRPC API, auth, indexes, and telemetry in one server.

Choose another tool when you only need transient messaging or a general-purpose queue with no durable event-log semantics. See [Comparing Orisun](/docs/comparison) for how Orisun differs from Kafka, EventStoreDB, PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, and NATS JetStream.
