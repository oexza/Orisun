# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Moved Docker Hub publishing and image documentation from `orexza/orisun` to the OrisunLabs-owned `orisunlabs/orisun` repository.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Updated the project, CI/release workflows, and FoundationDB development/test containers to Go 1.26.5.
- Updated the README and documentation examples for the `v0.6.0` module path, binaries, and versioned container images.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-18

### Breaking Changes

- The root Go module has moved from `github.com/oexza/Orisun` to `github.com/OrisunLabs/Orisun`. Go consumers must update module requirements and imports to the new path.

### Migration Notes

- Replace `github.com/oexza/Orisun` with `github.com/OrisunLabs/Orisun` in `go.mod` and Go imports, then run `go mod tidy`.
- Fetch the migrated module with `go get github.com/OrisunLabs/Orisun@v0.6.0`.
- The gRPC wire contract, stored event format, configuration, and runtime behavior are unchanged. Version `v0.5.0` remains available under the former module path for consumers that have not migrated.

### Changed

- Protobuf `go_package` metadata and regenerated Go descriptors now use the OrisunLabs module path.
- Internal imports, embedding examples, build linker paths, release builds, and admin API documentation now consistently use the canonical module identity.
- Go, Node, and Java client submodules now point to the migrated shared protobuf definitions; the standalone client package identities are unchanged.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-18

### Breaking Changes

- Backend extensions now implement `EventsSaver.SavePrepared` with a canonical `PreparedEventBatch` and `EventsRetriever.GetBatch` with a contiguous `ReadEventBatch`. Third-party storage backends must migrate from the previous `Save` and protobuf-shaped `Get` methods.
- Embedded Go callers now receive `ReadEventBatch` from `OrisunServer.GetEvents`. Read positions are exposed as scalar `CommitPosition` and `PreparePosition` fields, and `DateCreated` is a `time.Time`. The public gRPC/protobuf contract is unchanged.
- Embedded `OrisunServer.GetLatestByCriteria` callers now pass `LatestByCriteriaQuery` and receive `LatestByCriteriaBatch`. Matches are positionally aligned with the input criteria and expose a `Found` flag plus a packed `ReadEvent`.

### Changed

- Event input is normalized once at the API boundary before storage, eliminating repeated backend JSON decoding.
- Publisher, catch-up, and latest-by-criteria reads stay in packed representations. The publisher validates a complete advancing batch before publishing, uses an allocation-bounded JSON encoder, and persists one checkpoint after the whole batch is acknowledged.
- Read pages are bounded at 10,000 rows. The gRPC API rejects larger page requests, while backend drainers continue paging by position.

## 0.4.10 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- SQLite now uses a per-boundary group-commit write path for `SaveEvents`. Requests are queued per boundary, flushed in batches, and each request still runs its own CCC check and savepoint inside the shared transaction.
- SQLite group-commit coverage now exercises batching, overflow, cancellation, panic recovery, notifier behavior, clean shutdown, direct-mode parity, gap-free concurrent commits, and cross-flush expected-position conflicts.
- Release CI now includes FoundationDB Docker image coverage and backend-specific release artifacts.

### Fixed

- SQLite defaults to `ORISUN_SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS=FULL` so acknowledged WAL commits are fsynced before success returns. `NORMAL` remains available as an explicit throughput opt-out.
- SQLite CCC concurrency tests now cover concurrent saves against the same content-query context and verify that exactly one writer wins while losing writers receive `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
- SQLite group-commit tests now wait for the current blocker flush to start instead of assuming the single-flush counter begins at zero. This removes the CI timing race in `TestGroupCommit_InBatchSameExpectedPositionOnlyOneWins`.
- FoundationDB release builds now use a Go binding revision compatible with the packaged FoundationDB 7.3 runtime and headers, avoiding the API-800/header mismatch seen in failed release artifact builds.

### Changed

- SQLite stores derived operational state in `{boundary}_metadata.db` files so publisher/projector/admin metadata does not contend with the event-log writer.
- Release validation timeouts were extended for Docker-backed integration suites.
- Public docs and landing pages now include FoundationDB beta in the supported backend list.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `EventStore/GetLatestByCriteria` RPC: returns the latest event per criterion assembled from one consistent server-side read snapshot, plus a `context_position` for use as the next `expected_position`. Closes the mixed-snapshot gap where a context assembled from independent `GetEvents` calls can miss an event that committed between them below the observed max position. Implemented for PostgreSQL (single-statement `UNION ALL` of `LIMIT 1` lookups) and SQLite (one deferred read transaction).
- General-ledger workload e2e test (`TestE2E_LedgerWorkload_*`) driving concurrent double-entry transfers with carried balances through the public gRPC API, auditing carried-balance consistency, no-overdraft, money conservation, and debit/credit pairing.
- FoundationDB storage backend (`ORISUN_BACKEND=foundationdb`, built with `-tags foundationdb`). Event positions come from FoundationDB commit versionstamps, so plain appends and commands on different aggregates commit in parallel without a per-boundary sequence counter on the write path. Criteria reads and consistency conditions both require a ready covering index and fail closed (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`) otherwise; conflict ranges are scoped to the matching index slice. System indexes covering Orisun's own admin queries are created on the admin boundary at startup.
- `ORISUN_FDB_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `10000`) and `ORISUN_FDB_TRANSACTION_RETRY_LIMIT` (default unlimited) bound FoundationDB transactions.
- `scripts/fdb_test_container.sh` runs the FoundationDB backend tests against a throwaway single-node Docker cluster.

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL positions are now assigned in commit order per boundary: `insert_events_with_consistency_v3` takes a per-boundary advisory lock from position draw until commit. Previously a concurrent batch could draw lower `global_id`s, stay in flight while a later-drawn batch committed, and then commit below a context max another writer had already observed. A scalar expected-position check could not detect that case. The lock closes that window; the cost is that writes within one boundary serialise from draw to commit (the SQLite and FoundationDB backends already had commit-ordered positions). The function is replaced automatically at startup; no data migration.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Preserved pre-`0.3.0` read and subscription cursor semantics for PostgreSQL-backed stores. Clients can continue using `{0, 0}` as the beginning cursor for `GetEvents` and `CatchUpSubscribeToEvents`.
- PostgreSQL logical `commit_position` values are now derived as `MAX(global_id) + 1` for each committed batch, so no event is emitted at the exact `{0, 0}` position while existing zero-based `prepare_position` values remain unchanged.
- PostgreSQL startup migration now remaps legacy publisher and projector checkpoints to the corrected logical commit positions without changing stored `global_id` / `prepare_position` values.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-06

### Breaking Changes

- PostgreSQL event positions no longer expose PostgreSQL internal transaction IDs as `commit_position`.
  Existing PostgreSQL event rows are migrated on startup so `transaction_id` becomes a durable Orisun logical commit position derived from event `global_id` ordering. PostgreSQL's `pg_current_xact_id()` is still stored internally in `pg_xact_id` for stable-prefix visibility checks, but it is no longer part of the public EventStore position.
- Existing PostgreSQL projector checkpoints and publisher checkpoints are remapped to the new logical positions during startup migration. Consumers that persisted Orisun positions outside the Orisun database should rebuild or remap those external checkpoints before resuming from them.

### Migration Notes

- Stop Orisun cleanly before upgrading so publisher and projector checkpoints are current.
- Back up PostgreSQL before first starting Orisun `0.3.0`.
- Start one Orisun `0.3.0` node first and allow migrations to complete for all configured boundaries before starting the rest of a cluster.
- PostgreSQL major upgrades no longer need to preserve PostgreSQL transaction IDs for Orisun correctness after this migration. `pg_xact_id` is treated as current-cluster-only metadata and stale values are cleared when detected.

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL subscriptions and publishers no longer depend on PostgreSQL transaction IDs remaining monotonic across major upgrades, dump/restore migrations, logical replication moves, or fresh cluster restores.
- Missing projector checkpoints now resume from the before-first position instead of `(0, 0)`, preventing first logical event skips.
- Added Postgres live-subscription E2E coverage for write-after-subscribe delivery.
