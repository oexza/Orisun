Orisun is an open-source event database built for Command Context Consistency (CCC).

Applications declare the event context behind a decision with content-based queries. Orisun commits new events only if that context is still current, preserving the complete event history without forcing consistency rules into fixed streams or aggregates.

Orisun provides:

- Transactional event storage with SQLite, PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, and FoundationDB (beta).
- Query-driven optimistic concurrency and Dynamic Consistency Boundary-style append conditions.
- Per-boundary ordered catch-up and live subscriptions through embedded NATS JetStream.
- gRPC APIs, generated clients, server binaries, Docker images, and embedded runtimes.

## Documentation

See the [Orisun documentation](https://orisunlabs.github.io/Orisun/) for concepts, setup, APIs, client libraries, embedding, and operations.
