Orisun is an open-source event database built for Command Context Consistency (CCC).

Applications declare the event context behind a decision with content-based queries. Orisun commits new events only if that context is still current, preserving the complete event history without forcing consistency rules into fixed streams or aggregates.

Orisun provides:

- Transactional event storage with SQLite, PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, and FoundationDB (beta).
- Query-driven optimistic concurrency with content-scoped consistency checks.
- Per-boundary ordered catch-up and live subscriptions through embedded NATS JetStream.
- Event-backed boundary creation and import at runtime, without a startup boundary list.
- gRPC APIs, generated clients, server binaries, Docker images, and embedded runtimes.

## Documentation

See the [Orisun documentation](https://orisunlabs.github.io/Orisun/) for concepts, setup, the
[Admin boundary API](https://orisunlabs.github.io/Orisun/docs/api/admin#boundary-lifecycle),
client libraries, embedding, migration, and operations. Existing deployments
should follow the dedicated
[0.7.0 to 0.8.0 upgrade guide](https://orisunlabs.github.io/Orisun/docs/operations/upgrading-0.7-to-0.8)
before changing their server version.
